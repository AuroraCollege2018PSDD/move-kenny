#Kill Kenny III - The array version.
A really simple pygame game that demonstrates:
    opening a pygame window
    setting the background colour
    displaying a sprite from an image
    using random coordinates
    checking for mouse clicks
    checking is mouse click is in the rectangle of the sprite
    updating the sprite image
    playing a sound
    using a clock to control loop rate and activities
    the use of classes
